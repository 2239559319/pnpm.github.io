With pnpm, lodash will be saved in a\nsingle place on the disk and a hard link will put it into the node_modules where it should\nbe installed.\nAs a result, you save gigabytes of space on your disk and you have a lot faster installations!\nIf you'd like more details about the unique node_modules structure that pnpm creates and\nwhy it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small article: Why should we use pnpm?\n"},"installation.html":{"url":"installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nUsing a standalone script:\ncurl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer | node\nVia npm:\nnpm install -g pnpm\nOnce you first installed pnpm, you can upgrade it using pnpm:\npnpm install -g pnpm\n\nDo you wanna use pnpm on CI servers?

Hence, you should set configs for pnpm the same way you would for npm.\nFurthermore, pnpm uses the same configs that npm uses for doing installations.

So there will be one store per disk.\nIf there is a home directory on the current disk, then the store is created in /.pnpm-store. If there is no\nhomedir on the disk, then the store is created in the root. For example, if installation is happening on disk D\nthen the store will be created in D:\\.pnpm-store.\nIt is possible to set a store from a different disk but in that case pnpm will copy, not link, packages from the store.\nHard links are possible only inside a filesystem.\noffline\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, pnpm will use only packages already available in the store.\nIf a package won't be found locally, the installation will fail.\nprefer-offline\nAdded in: v1.28.0\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, staleness checks for cached data will be bypassed, but missing data will be requested from the server.\nTo force full offline mode, use --offline.\nnetwork-concurrency\n\nDefault: 16\nType: Number\n\nControls the maximum number of HTTP requests that can be done simultaneously.\nchild-concurrency\n\nDefault: 5\nType: Number\n\nControls the number of child processes run parallelly to build node modules.\nlock\n\nDefault: true\nType: Boolean\n\nDangerous!

All the requires of lodash will import awesome-lodash.\nSometimes you'll want to use two different versions of a package in your project. Easy:\npnpm install lodash1@npm:lodash@1\npnpm install lodash2@npm:lodash@2\nNow you can require the first version of lodash via require('lodash1') and the second via require('lodash2').\nThis gets even more powerful when combined with hooks. Maybe you want to replace lodash with awesome-lodash\nin all the packages in node_modules. You can easily achieve that with the following pnpmfile.js:\nmodule.exports = {\n  hooks: {\n    readPackage\n  }\n}\n\nfunction readPackage (pkg) {\n  if (pkg.dependencies && pkg.dependencies.lodash) {\n    pkg.dependencies.lodash = 'npm:awesome-lodash@^1.0.0'\n  }\n  return pkg\n}\n\n"},"recipes/continuous-integration.html":{"url":"recipes/continuous-integration.html","title":"Continuous Integration","keywords":"","body":"Continuous Integration\npnpm can easily be used in various continuous integration systems.\nTravis\nOn Travis CI, you can use pnpm for installing your dependencies by adding this to your .travis.yml file:\nbefore_install:\n  - curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer | node\ninstall:\n  - pnpm install\n\nAppVeyor\nOn AppVeyor, you can use pnpm for installing your dependencies by adding this to your appveyor.yml:\ninstall:\n  - ps: Install-Product node $env:nodejs_version\n  - curl -L https://unpkg.com/@pnpm/self-installer | node\n  - pnpm install\n\n"},"benchmark.html":{"url":"benchmark.html","title":"Benchmark","keywords":"","body":"Benchmark\npnpm is faster than npm and Yarn.

The path to a package in the store is the package's ID.\nPackages from npm-compatible registries\n//\nE.g.:\nregistry.npmjs.org/gulp/2.1.0\nregistry.npmjs.org/@cycle/dom/14.1.0\nregistry.node-modules.io/@wmhilton/log/1.1.0\nPackages from Git\n//\nE.g.: github.com/alexGugel/ied/b246270b53e43f1dc469df0c9b9ce19bb881e932\nstore.json\nA file in the root of store that contains information about projects depending on specific packages from the store.\n{\n  \"/home/john_smith/src/ied\": [\n    \"registry.npmjs.org/npm/3.10.2\"\n  ],\n  \"/home/john_smith/src/ied\": [\n    \"registry.npmjs.org/arr-flatten/1.0.1\",\n    \"registry.npmjs.org/byline/5.0.0\",\n    \"registry.npmjs.org/cache-manager/2.2.0\"\n  ]\n}\n\n"},"symlinked-node-modules-structure.html":{"url":"symlinked-node-modules-structure.html","title":"Symlinked node_modules structure","keywords":"","body":"Symlinked node_modules structure\n\nThis article only describes how pnpm's node_modules are structured when there are no packages with peer dependencies.\nFor the more complex scenario of dependencies with peers, see How peers are resolved.\n\npnpm's node_modules layout uses symbolic links to create a nested structure of dependencies.\nEvery package@version is linked to node_modules from the global store only once.\nLet's say you install foo@1.0.0 that depends on bar@1.0.0. pnpm will hard link both packages to node_modules like this:\nnode_modules\n└─ .registry.npmjs.org\n   ├─ bar/1.0.0/node_modules/bar\n   |  ├─ index.js\n   |  └─ package.json\n   └─ foo/1.0.0/node_modules/foo\n      ├─ index.js\n      └─ package.json\nThese are the only \"real files\" in node_modules. Once all the packages are hard linked to node_modules, symlinks are\ncreated to build the nested dependency tree structure.\nAs you might have noticed, both packages are hard linked into a subfolder inside a node_modules folder (foo/1.0.0/node_modules/foo).\nThis is needed to:\n\nallow packages to require themselves. foo should be able to do require('foo/package.json').\navoid circular symlinks. Dependencies of packages are placed in the same folder in which the dependent packages are.\nFor Node.js it doesn't make a difference whether dependencies are inside the package's node_modules or in any other\nnode_modules in the parent directories.\n\nThe next stage of installation is symlinking dependencies. bar is going to be symlinked to the foo/1.0.0/node_modules folder:\nnode_modules\n└─ .registry.npmjs.org\n   ├─ bar/1.0.0/node_modules/bar\n   └─ foo/1.0.0/node_modules\n      ├─ foo\n      └─ bar -> ../../../bar/1.0.0/node_modules/bar\nfoo is going to be symlinked to the root node_modules folder because foo is a dependency of the project:\nnode_modules\n├─ foo -> .registry.npmjs.org/foo/1.0.0/node_modules/foo\n└─ .registry.npmjs.org\n   ├─ bar/1.0.0/node_modules/bar\n   └─ foo/1.0.0/node_modules\n      ├─ foo\n      └─ bar -> ../../../bar/1.0.0/node_modules/bar\nThis is a very simple example. However, the layout will stay flat in the file system regardless of the number of dependencies\nand the depth of the dependency tree.\nLet's add qar@2.0.0 as a dependency of bar and foo. This is how the node_modules will look like:\nnode_modules\n├─ foo -> .registry.npmjs.org/foo/1.0.0/node_modules/foo\n└─ .registry.npmjs.org\n   ├─ qar/2.0.0/node_modules/qar\n   ├─ bar/1.0.0/node_modules\n   |  ├─ bar\n   |  └─ qar -> ../../../qar/2.0.0/node_modules/qar\n   └─ foo/1.0.0/node_modules\n      ├─ foo\n      ├─ qar -> ../../../qar/2.0.0/node_modules/qar\n      └─ bar -> ../../../bar/1.0.0/node_modules/bar\nAs you can see, even though the depth of the tree is bigger (foo > bar > qar), the directory depth in the file system is still the same.\nThis layout might look weird at first glance, but it is completely Node.js-compatible! When resolving modules, Node.js ignores symlinks.\nSo when bar is required from foo/1.0.0/node_modules/foo/index.js, Node.js is not using bar from foo/1.0.0/node_modules/bar.\nbar is resolved to its real location: bar/1.0.0/node_modules/bar. As a consequence, bar can also resolve its dependencies\nwhich are in bar/1.0.0/node_modules.\nA great bonus of this layout is that only packages that are really in the dependencies are accessible. With flattened node_modules, all hoisted\npackages are accessible. To read more about why this is an advantage, see pnpm's strictness helps to avoid silly bugs.\n"},"how-peers-are-resolved.html":{"url":"how-peers-are-resolved.html","title":"How peers are resolved","keywords":"","body":"How peers are resolved\nOne of the very great features of pnpm is that in one project, a specific version of a package will always have\none set of dependencies. There is one exclusion from it though - packages with peer dependencies.\nPeer dependencies are resolved from dependencies installed higher in the dependency tree.\nThat means if foo@1.0.0 has two peers (bar@^1 and baz@^1) then it might have different sets of dependencies\nin the same project.\n- foo-parent-1\n  - bar@1.0.0\n  - baz@1.0.0\n  - foo@1.0.0\n- foo-parent-2\n  - bar@1.0.0\n  - baz@1.1.0\n  - foo@1.0.0\nIn the example above, foo@1.0.0 is installed for foo-parent-1 and foo-parent-2. Both packages have bar and bazas well, but\nthey depend on different versions of baz. As a result, foo@1.0.0 has two different sets of dependencies: one with baz@1.0.0\nand the other one with baz@1.1.0. In order to support these use cases, pnpm has to hard link foo@1.0.0 as many times as many different dependency sets it has.\nNormally, if a package does not have peer dependencies, it is hard linked to a node_modules folder next to symlinks of its dependencies.\n\n- .registry.npmjs.org / foo / 1.0.0 / node_modules\n  hard link to the specific foo package in the store\n  - foo\n  dependencies of foo, symlinks to folders where these deps are resolved with their deps\n  - qux\n  - plugh\n\n\nHowever, if foo has peer dependencies, there cannot be one single set of dependencies for it, so\nwe create different sets, for different peer dependency resolutions:\n\n- .registry.npmjs.org / foo / 1.0.0\n\n  - bar@1.0.0+baz@1.0.0 / node_modules\n    hard link\n    - foo\n    symlinks to peer dependencies\n    - bar v1.0.0\n    - baz v1.0.0\n    regular dependencies of foo\n    - qux\n    - plugh\n\n  - bar@1.0.0+baz@1.1.0 / node_modules\n    hard link\n    - foo\n    symlinks to peer dependencies\n    - bar v1.0.0\n    - baz v1.1.0\n    regular dependencies of foo\n    - qux\n    - plugh\n\n\nWe create symlinks either to the foo that is inside bar@1.0.0+bar@1.0.0/node_modules or to the one in bar@1.0.0+bar@1.1.0/node_modules.\nAs a consequence, the Node.js module resolver algorithm will find the correct peers.\nIf the resolved peer is a direct dependency of the project, it is not grouped separately with the dependent package.\nThis is done to make it easier to make predictable and fast named (pnpm i foo) and general (pnpm i) installations.\nSo if the project dependends on bar@1.0.0, the dependencies from our example will be grouped like this:\n\n- bar v1.0.0\n- .registry.npmjs.org / foo / 1.0.0\n\n  - baz@1.0.0 / node_modules\n    hard link\n    - foo\n    symlinks to peer dependencies\n    - baz v1.0.0\n    regular dependencies of foo\n    - qux\n    - plugh\n\n  - baz@1.1.0 / node_modules\n    hard link\n    - foo\n    symlinks to peer dependencies\n    - baz v1.1.0\n    regular dependencies of foo\n    - qux\n    - plugh\n\n\nIf a package has no peer dependencies but has dependencies with peers that are resolved higher in the tree, then\nthat transitive package can appear in the project with different sets of dependencies. For instance, there's package a@1.0.0\nwith a single dependency framework@1.0.0. framework@1.0.0 has a peer dependency plugin@^1. a@1.0.0 will never resolve the\npeers of framework@1.0.0, so it becomes dependent from the peers of framework@1.0.0 as well.\nHere's how it will look like in node_modules/.registry.npmjs.org, in case if a@1.0.0 will need to appear twice in the project's\nnode_modules, once resolved with plugin@1.0.0 and once with plugin@1.1.0.\n\n- .registry.npmjs.org\n  - a / 1.0.0\n    - plugin@1.0.0 / node_modules\n      - a\n      -> .registry.npmjs.org / framework / 1.0.0 / plugin@1.0.0 / node_modules / framework\n      - framework v1.0.0 but dependent on plugin@1.0.0\n    - plugin@1.1.0 / node_modules\n      - a\n      -> .registry.npmjs.org / framework / 1.0.0 / plugin@1.1.0 / node_modules / framework\n      - framework v1.0.0 but dependent on plugin@1.1.0\n\n  - framework / 1.0.0\n    - plugin@1.0.0 / node_modules\n      - framework\n      - plugin v1.0.0\n    - plugin@1.1.0 / node_modules\n      - framework\n      - plugin v1.1.0\n\n  - plugin\n    - 1.0.0 / node_modules / plugin\n    - 1.1.0 / node_modules / plugin\n\n"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nWhy does my node_modules folder use disk space if packages are stored in a global store?\npnpm creates hard links from the global store to project's node_modules folders.\nHard links point to the same place on the disk where the original files are.\nSo, for example, if you have foo in your project as a dependency and it occupies 1MB of space,\nthen it will look like it occupies 1MB of space in the project's node_modules folder and\nthe same amount of space in the global store. However, that 1MB is the same space on the disk\naddressed from two different locations. So in total foo occupies 1MB,\nnot 2MB.\nFor more on this subject:\n\nWhy do hard links seem to take the same space as the originals?\nA thread from the pnpm chat room\nAn issue in the pnpm repo\n\nDoes it work on Windows? It is harder to create symlinks on Windows\nUsing symlinks on Windows is problematic indeed. That is why pnpm uses junctions instead of symlinks on Windows OS.\nDoes it work on Windows? Nested node_modules approach is basically incompatible with Windows\nEarly versions of npm had issues because of nesting all node_modules (see Node's nested node_modules approach is basically incompatible with Windows). However, pnpm does not create deep folders, it stores all packages flatly and uses symlinks to create the dependency tree structure.\nWhat about circular symlinks?\nAlthough pnpm uses symlinks to put dependencies into node_modules folders, circular symlinks are avoided because parent packages are placed into the same node_modules folder in which their dependencies are. So foo's dependencies are not in foo/node_modules but foo is in node_modules/foo, together with its own dependencies.\nWhy have hard links at all? Why not symlink directly to the global store?\nOne package can have different sets of dependencies on one machine.\nIn project A foo@1.0.0 can have dependency resolved to bar@1.0.0 but in project B the same dependency of foo might\nresolve to bar@1.1.0. So pnpm hard links foo@1.0.0 to every project where it is used, in order to create different sets\nof dependencies for it.\nDirect symlinking to the global store would work with Node's --preserve-symlinks flag. But --preserve-symlinks comes\nwith a bunch of different issues, so we decided to stick with hard links.\nFor more details about why this decision was made, see: https://github.com/nodejs/node-eps/issues/46.\n"},"support.html":{"url":"support.html","title":"Support","keywords":"","body":"Support\n\nStack Overflow\nGitter chat\nTwitter\n\n"}}}
