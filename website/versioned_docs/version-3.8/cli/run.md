Aliases: `run-script`

Runs a defined package script.

## Synopsis

```text
pnpm run [[-r] [--no-bail] [--no-sort] [--workspace-concurrency=&lt;number>]]
     &lt;command> [-- &lt;args>...]

pnpm multi run &lt;command> [-- &lt;args>...]

pnpm recursive run &lt;command> [-- &lt;args>...]
```

In addition to the shellâ€™s pre-existing `PATH`, `pnpm run` adds `node_modules/.bin`
to the `PATH` provided to `scripts`. As of v3.5, when executed inside a workspace,
`<workspace root>/node_modules/.bin` is also added to the `PATH`, so if a tool
is installed in the workspace root, it may be called in any workspace package's `scripts`.

## Options

### --filter &lt;package_selector>
